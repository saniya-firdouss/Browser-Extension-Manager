# 🌐 Browser Extension Manager

Hey there! 👋

This is my take on the **Browser Extension Manager** challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/). I built it using good old **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **vanilla JavaScript**—no fancy frameworks, just clean, responsive, and functional code.

## ✨ Features

* ✅ Fully responsive layout – works well on all screen sizes
* 🌗 Dark mode support – easy on the eyes (especially at night!)
* 🔘 Working buttons:

  * **Activate/Deactivate** extensions
  * **Remove** extensions
* 🎯 Designed to be clean, intuitive, and user-friendly

## 🛠️ Tech Used

* HTML5 (not HTML3 😄)
* CSS3
* JavaScript (vanilla)

## 📬 Feedback Welcome!

This was a fun project to work on, and I’d love to hear what you think.
